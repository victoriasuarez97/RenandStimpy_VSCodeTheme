So, if you liked the idea and want to add color customizations for a language that hasn't been done, remember to choose a character from *Ren & Stimpy Show* and use its color palette, so we are all on the same page.

## How to

First of all, clone the repo. Then, open your Visual Studio Code and go to the *Ren and Stimpy Color Palette-color-theme.json* file and add the colors you want to add. After that, you can open a PR so I can check it out and publish it on the Marketplace to share your changes with everyone ‚ú®

**DISCLAIMER:** If you dont want to share your changes but you don't like something, you can change it on your own *settings.json* file with this theme installed.

Here is a link that could help if this is your first time doing this:

Also, if you see some feature that is not colored and don't know how Visual Studio Code calls it, a great tip is to do Ctrl+Shift+P and click on the **Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes**. Click on the dropdown option, then click on whatever item you want to add some color.
